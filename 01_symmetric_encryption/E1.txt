    Run the code in a virtual environment:

source env/bin/activate

    deactivate using

deactivate

    Run using:

python3 ppmcrypt.py


Running the script will generate .ppm (encrypted & corrupted) images for each of the tasks (as well as a env directory).

First 3 tasks are simple implementations of the following encryption methods: ECB, CBC, CTR.
Task 4 uses GCM method which features authentication, allowing for safe and good encryption.
Task 5 shows that GCM still has a downside, as the metadata would also need to be protected.
